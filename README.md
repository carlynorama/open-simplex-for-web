# open-simplex-noise-for-web-js

If you are making a node.js project using TypeScript the original library is https://github.com/joshforisha/open-simplex-noise-js

This repo exists because I was trying to combine this library with p5js while maintaining the TypeScript.

It turns out the `.tsconfig` file needs are very different, and EVEN THEN every time one compiles you have to go, by hand, and update the imports to point to the `.js` file.
